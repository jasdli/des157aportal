            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Survey research is a crucial step in the UX process. When visitors submit and input their information, it’s significant to create effective forms. Great form design, including designing the form’s layout, format, and UX appearance enhances the UX experience. Salim Ansari’s <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>offers 20 helpful strategies for improving form design. 
            </p>
            <p>One major takeaway from the article is that empathy is the key, think of yourself as the one filling out and submitting forms. Think about the instances you, as a research participant, try to fill out forms. People prefer straightforward and easy-to-understand forms. Basic web form design should include creating single-column layouts, using an asterisk (*) to mark the required fields, and asking easy questions in the beginning. Another tip from this journal that I did not notice before is to place a form label above an input field instead of inline form field labels. Labels that are located inside the fields themselves disappear once users fill in the input, which leads to many drawbacks. Another strategy to create a more efficient form design is to avoid a dropdown menu and use multiple selections to make all options visible.

            <h2>Helpful Tool</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> is a convenient and easy-to-use software to create forms and surveys. Most people are very familiar with Google Forms. Forms generated from Google Forms always have a single-column layout and legible fonts. It is a useful tool for new designers to get started, with no prior experience required.
