            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Survey research is a crucial step in the UX process. When visitors submit and input their information, it’s significant to create effective forms. Great form design, including designing the form’s layout, format, and UX appearance enhances the UX experience. Salim Ansari’s <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>offers 20 helpful strategies for improving form design. 
            </p>
            <p>One major takeaway from the article is that empathy is the key, think of yourself as the one filling out and submitting forms. Think about the instances you, as a research participant, try to fill out forms. People prefer straightforward and easy-to-understand forms. Basic web form design should include creating single-column layouts, using an asterisk (*) to mark the required fields, and asking easy questions in the beginning. Another tip from this journal that I did not notice before is to place a form label above an input field instead of inline form field labels. Labels that are located inside the fields themselves disappear once users fill in the input, which leads to many drawbacks. Another strategy to create a more efficient form design is to avoid a dropdown menu and use multiple selections to make all options visible.

            <h2>Helpful Tool</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> is a convenient and easy-to-use software to create forms and surveys. Most people are very familiar with Google Forms. Forms generated from Google Forms always have a single-column layout and legible fonts. It is a useful tool for new designers to get started, with no prior experience required.

            <h1>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Naema Baskanderi’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> introduces the use of modal windows. Modal windows are the child windows in front of the main window. The usage of these pop-up windows includes grabbing users’ attention, showing additional information, and requiring user input. The most common modal windows are sign-in forms and alert boxes. The design of modal windows often needs to darken the background window to keep the pop-up windows visible to users. Modal windows are usually placed in the upper half of the screen and take up less than 50% of the screen for overlay. Modal windows need to have a descriptive title to inform users of their purposes. The button labels are positioned near the bottom or below the text. Buttons are significant in the UI process because users need to click the buttons to exit and return to the parent application or navigate to another page.

            MICHAEL GONCHAR’s  10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills presente a way to practice students' visual thinking skills.  People rely on  using everyday observations to make inferences about the background stories of photos. People form a better understanding of the world by analyzing and viewing photographs. These photographs represent the daily lives of people. When we see these photographs, we have a better knowledge of things we have seen before or things we have no ideas about. Oftentimes, they portray people who are living with completely different lives.  As a result, we learn about the unknowns and guess the background stories from these pictures.

            <a href="https://stelostories.co">Stelo Stories</a>is an interesting interactive website that uses images and videos to deliver its message to users. By introducing different films and their background stories, the website uses mouse interaction features and smooth scroll function to enhance user experience. The way Stelo Stories tells stories resembles a slideshow. Users have to scroll their mouse over to move on. The yellow “light” also follows wherever the mouse interacts with the webpage.
