    <h1>Final Project Design Brief</h1>
    <section>
    <h1>Project Summary</h1>
    <p>My final project will refine my studio 1, the madlib generator by creating a flipbook version postcards and adding more background context.

        <h1>Comparison Project 1</h1>
        <p>Some madlib websites that I found are outdated with simple designs. The website <a href="https://www.madtakes.com/index.php">Mad Takes</a> provides madlib games with a variety of topics. The content is crowded which creates cognitive load in interface design. The navigation links on top are small and easy to ignore. A strategy to improve the UI would be to make the overlay of the madlib box bigger. The border box is positioned at the center of the page, which only takes up half of the screen. However, all information is displayed in the overlay. Users soon recognize that there is a lot of empty space in the background with crowded information at the center.

        <h1>Project Goals</h1>
        <p>For my final project, I want to incorporate the design of project 1 and 2 together. The final project is going to be a more detailed madlib generator. The beginning should illustrate the background story of my traveling hamster. To improve my UI design, I want to use the smart scroll function to make my archive easy to navigate. After users enter the words in madlib, the project will generate a flipbook of postcards which shows the journey of my hamster. The flipbook includes various illustrations of my hamster visiting different places and doing activities. To complete my final project, I need to design multiple overlays.

            <h1>Design Strategies</h1>
            <p>To create the flipbook, I will design two arrows that go for the next page and previous page. I will use javascript to make them work so that users can flip pages as they click on the arrows. The general color design is likely going to be consistent with my studio 1 color scheme. For my flipbook, I am going to add different colors to every page.

        <h1>Interaction Strategies</h1>
        <p>The interaction will mainly focus on the story page. I will make any navigation links hover or pop out when the mouse hover on the text. The icons and images will move when the user clicks on them. The only user interaction the flipbook has is going to be the arrows. I am also considering making the flipbook flips automatically every few seconds. I need to explore more on time-based animations to make the flipbook change pages. When the users hover on the images of flipbook, the pictures will enlarge so users can see them better. The magnifier animation in my studio 2 will apply to my final project design as well. 
        </p>

    <h1>Experience Goals</h1>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to invite users to read the story behind the traveling hamster and read about its journey. I hope my final project will be something cute or inspiring that makes the audience smile or relax. I want my final project to act as a mood booster that helps people relieve stress or keep up with good moods.
