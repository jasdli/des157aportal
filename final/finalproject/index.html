            <div style="grid-column: 1;">
                Once upon a time, in a cozy little home, there lived a curious hamster named Jojo. Jojo loved to run on his wheel, nibble on his food, and snuggle up in his soft bedding, but he often wondered what lay beyond the walls of his cage.
     
     
            </div>
            <div style="grid-column: 1;">
                One day, while his owner was away, Jojo decided to find out. He squeezed through a small hole in his cage and scampered out into the big, wide world. He looked around and saw that everything was so different and exciting!

            <div class="container reveal">
            <div style="grid-column: 2;">
                Jojo ran through fields of green grass and felt the wind rushing through his fur. He climbed trees and balanced on branches, feeling like a true adventurer. He even splashed through a little pond and felt the cool water on his paws.
     
     
            </div>
            <div style="grid-column: 2;">
                As he journeyed on, Jojo met all sorts of creatures that he'd never seen before. He befriended a clever rabbit who showed him how to hop higher and a friendly squirrel who helped him collect some nuts for his travels. He even had to be careful to avoid a hungry hawk that swooped down from the sky!
     
     
            </div>
    
            <div style="grid-column: 1;">But Jojo wasn't afraid. He was having too much fun exploring the world and trying new things. He nibbled on sweet berries, tasted crunchy nuts, and even munched on some green leaves. He discovered that there was so much more to the world than just his little cage.

            After many weeks of traveling, Jojo finally returned home. He was tired, but he had a big smile on his face. He knew that he had lived a big adventure, and he was proud of himself for being so brave.
            
            From then on, Jojo continued to dream big and explore the world around him. He was happy to be back in his cozy little home, but he also knew that there was so much more to see and do. And he was excited to share his stories with all his new animal friends.
