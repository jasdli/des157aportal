        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <h2>Color scheme</h2>
        <p>I received some feedback about changing the color scheme of postcard images. Since my original hamster postcard has a red and blue frame, it’s more smooth if I make the frame purple-blue. The colors of my envelope frame will look more consistent with the purple sunset in the postcard.

        <h2>Create an input form
        </h2>
        <p>My users also suggested me that If I am recreating my studio 1 project, I might need an input form to put the text to generate the flip book. I can place the input form below the story section. Once users complete the input form and submit, there will be another overlay that shows the madlib.

        <h2>Scroll transition
        </h2>
        <p>They recommended me to add transitions to my website. The best way to do this is to add some scroll functions to reduce cognitive load. As users scroll down to the website, the story will “pop up”. I can apply ease in out animation to the content.

        <h1>Plans to change</h1>
        <p>After receiving feedback from my users, I will attempt to recreate the color of my images. Depending on how my website looks, I may consider adding a color background. Although an input form was not part of my original plan, I will evaluate its necessity for achieving my website's goals. If my flipbook is not functioning properly, I will switch from coding the flipbook to redesigning my madlib. To make the content more digestible, I will divide my story into two sections and apply scroll functions to each section. This will allow users to read smaller amounts of content at one time.</p>
