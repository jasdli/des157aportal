            The rose succulents refer to the genus of Greenovia. The best way to care for them is to plant them in pots. We put the plant on our balcony that's sunny in the morning and shady during the heat of the afternoon. Rose succulents need a lot of light. Rose Succulents don't turn colors when they're exposed to lots of light like other succulents.

            This is another section of “our garden area”. To care for these indoor plants, we rotate them frequently for them to get direct sunlight. When we water our succulent plants, we water the soil directly. Using a spray bottle to water the succulents will cause moldy leaves and brittle roots.

        <nav>
          <ul>
            <span><li><a>Choose the right soil: Succulents need well-draining soil that allows water to pass through easily. You can use a special succulent soil mix or make your own by mixing equal parts of sand, perlite, and potting soil.</a></li></span>
            <span><li><a>Water sparingly: Succulents are adapted to survive in dry environments, so they don't need frequent watering. Only water them when the soil is completely dry. Overwatering can cause root rot, which can be fatal for the plant.</a></li></span>
            <span><li><a>Provide enough light: Succulents need plenty of sunlight to thrive. Place them in a bright spot where they can get at least six hours of direct sunlight each day.</a></li></span>
            <span><li><a>Keep the temperature consistent: Succulents prefer warm temperatures, ideally between 60°F and 80°F. Avoid placing them in drafty areas or near air conditioning units, as sudden temperature changes can stress the plant.</a></li></span>
            <span><li><a>Fertilize occasionally: Succulents don't need much fertilizer, but you can give them a boost by fertilizing them once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced fertilizer and dilute it to half strength.</a></li></span>

      <h3>Night Time</h3>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <span><li><a>Provide additional light with grow lights: If your succulents aren't receiving enough natural light during the day, you can use grow lights to supplement their light needs during the night. Use grow lights that emit red and blue wavelengths, as these are the most important for plant growth.</a></li></span>
          <span><li><a>Use a timer: To ensure that your succulents receive the right amount of light, use a timer to regulate the grow lights. Set the timer to turn on the grow lights for 6-8 hours, and turn them off for the remaining 16-18 hours.</a></li></span>
          <span><li><a>Keep the temperature consistent: Succulents prefer warm temperatures during the day, but they also need cool temperatures at night to rest and grow. Maintain a temperature range between 55°F and 65°F during the night to provide optimal growing conditions for your succulents.</a></li></span>
          <span><li><a>Avoid overwatering: Succulents require less water during the night, as they are not actively growing. Avoid watering your succulents at night, as the soil may not have enough time to dry out before the next day.</a></li></span>
          <span><li><a>Rotate the plant: If you're using grow lights, rotate the succulent regularly to ensure all parts receive equal light exposure. Otherwise, some parts may become elongated or deformed due to uneven light distribution.</a></li></span>
